## How to use the Random Module in Python:
 - The random module let us to access to functions that support alot of operations, important one of them is to generate random numbers.
 
 ### __Random Functions__ :
  - 1 - __Randint__: is a function to produce a random integer, it's accept two arguments a lowest and highest number and the first one should be less than the second.EX: random.randint(0, 5)
  - 2 - __Random__: is a function to produce a large random number by multiply it in any number. EX: random.random() * 100
  - 3 - __Choice__: is a built-in function to choice a random element or value from a list.EX: list = [1,2,3] , random.choice(list) ==> 2 or 1 or 3
  - 4 - __Shuffle__: is a method takes a sequence of list, string or tuple and rearrange the order of the items.EX: list = [1,2,3] , random.shuffle(list) ==> [3,2,1] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] or etc..
  - 5 - __Randrange__: is a method returns a randomly selected element from the specified range.EX: random.randrange(0,100) ==> 99 or 5 or any number between 0(included),100(not included)

 ## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
 - __Risk Analysis__: is a procees to identify the risks in software you built and prioritizing them to test.
 - Why use it? to highlights the potential problem areas. it helps the developers and amngers to mitigate the risks.
 
 - The possible risks you could encounter:
   - 1 - use a new hardware.
   - 2 - use a new technology
   - 3 - use a new automation tool.
   - 4 - the sequnce of code.
   - 5 - availability of test resources for the application.
   
 - certain risks that are unavoidable:
   - 1 - the time that you allocated to testing.
   - 2 - a defect leakage due  to the complexity or size of the application.
   - 3 - urgency from  the clients to deliver the project.
   - 4 - incomplete requirements.
   
 - tackle the situation be take care of:
   - 1 - conduct risk assessment review meeting.
   - 2 - use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas.
   - 3 - create a risk assessment database for future use.
   - 4 - identify and notice the risk magnitude indictors: high, medium, low.
  
 - Risk identification:
   - 1 - business risks: is the risk is may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
   - 2 - testing risks: you should be know with the project you working on by using software testing tools.
   - 3 - premature risks: knowledge to analyze the risk with untested software is required.
   - 4 - software risks: you should to be know with the risks with software development process.
   
 - the perspective of risk assessment:
   - 1 - Effect: to assess risk by effect.
   - 2 - Cause: to assess risk by cause is opposite.
   - 3 - Likelihood: to assess risk by likelihood.
   
 - perform risk analysis:
   - 1 - searching the risk.
   - 2 - analyzing the impact of each individual risk.
   - 3 - measures for the risk identified.
