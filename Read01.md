- but all of these uncomfortable reasons to achieve your goals.

Beginners Guide to Big O (Links to an external site.):
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 
O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 
O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set
Logarithms:
Binary search (Links to an external site.) is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.
This type of algorithm is described as O(log N). 
Facts and Myths about Python names and values:
we have only one list, how much use variables to refer to it. impossible to get new list.
the variable used rebinding.(using var+=1, etc)
 the list used mutating. (using the append method)
the list used rebinding.(using list+=1, etc)
x+=y it means x=x+y but actually x=x.__iadd__y
the vars have no scope.
the name has no type.
