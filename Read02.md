Readings: Testing and Modules :

Module :

- Modules in Python are simply Python files with a .py extension.
- The name of the module will be the name of the file.
- A Python module can have a set of functions, classes or variables defined and implemented.
- is a large, unwidly file divided into manageable subtasks or modules.
for reasons :
  - simlplicity.
  - maintainability.
  - reuseability.
  - scoping.
- three different ways to define a module in Python:
1- can be written by Python it self.
2- can be written by C and loaded at runtime like regular expression.
3- bulit-in contained in the interpreter like itertool module.

Pytest:
- helps you to write the better programs.
- it's framwork makes it easy to write small tests to support functional testing for applications and libraries.
- you can write to test databases, API, even UI.
- very easy to start because of its simple and easy syntax.
- automatically detect tests.
- open source.
- skip tests.
- can run tests in parallel.
- can run a specific test or asubset of tests.

Recursion:
- function call its self directly or in directly.
- dierct recursion call its self in same function.
- indirect recursion call another function.

Lists:
- python has a great built-in list type named list.
- Are literals written in square brackets[].

string:
- python has built-in string class named "str" with many handy features.
- string methods: the method is like a function, but its run on an object.
